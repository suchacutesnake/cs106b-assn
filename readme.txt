All the code I wrote for this class was gathered in file "cppEditedFiles".

No extra feature finished except assn 5 "heapPatientQueue".
I didn't know the meaning of "throw a string exception" until I was doing Assignment 5 - PatientQueue. Therefore, I ignored all the "string exception" steps, which should be completed by including "error.h".
